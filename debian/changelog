    in ::Perl. Applied patch by David Pashley - Thanks! (Closes: #249472)
  * Fixed an uninitialized substitution warning if there is no
    changelog. Applied patch semantically equivalent to Edward Bett's,
    thanks! (Closes: #243338)
  * Handles the cases where POD has DETAILS instead of DESCRIPTION, as
    well as cases where the POD files are DOS-like (i.e., lines end with
    \r\n). Applied Edward Betts' patch, thanks! (Closes: #267899)
  * Documented the --build and --install switches in the synopsis,
    forced the module to be built if only --install is specified.
    (Closes: #269606)

dh-make-perl (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Make make clean cleaner.
  * debian/control: I'm a DD now!
  * dh-make-perl:
    + Don't use rename, as it won't work across devices.
    + Rewrite the ugly stuff that inserts the found docs and the changes file
      into the rules file. IMO this whole thing has to be rewritten *sigh*
    + Fix --build switch by calling make directly with the -C switch. Thanks
      for the report to Emanuele Zeppieri <ema_zep@libero.it> (Closes:
      #241159)
    + Work with DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME as dch does.
    + Fix regexp finding the used modules to allow stuff like use Gtk2"-init"
      and Foobar(). Thanks for the report to Eric Schwartz 
      <emschwar@fc.hp.com>. (Closes: #234774)
  .
  ### I'm planning to rewrite dh-make-perl over the next few weeks. Please
  ### mail me if you want to contribute or have ideas for new features.

dh-make-perl (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Let dh-make-perl also work on directories other than ".". (Closes:
    #230382)
  * Apply patch from Gaal Yahas <gaal@forum2.org> to the CPAN code, now
    CPAN.pm itself chooses the default mirror. Thanks Gaal! (Closes: #230409)
  * Fixed "Use of uninitialized value" warnings in the default override file.
  * Introducing the --exclude|i switch to allow people to exclude some files
    from the search for docs and stuff. This defaults to the exclusion of
    CVS/.svn dirs. (Closes: #223411, #227183, #227113)
  * Now prints out the Perl error message when failing to open a file.
  * Add a note to the end of the long description to state that it was
    automagically extracted from the source. (Closes: #226146)
  * Updated both rules.noxs and rules.xs.
  * Updated manpage.

    Thanks to Ilya Martynov <ilya@martynov.org>. (Closes: #209059)
