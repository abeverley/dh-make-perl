=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over

=cut

use Debian::AptContents ();
use DhMakePerl::Config;
use version          ();

=item run( I<%init> )

Runs DhMakePerl.

Unless the %init contains an I<cfg> member, constructs and instance of
L<DhMakePerl::Config> and assigns it to I<$init{cfg}>.

Then determines the dh-make-perl command requested (via cfg->command), loads
the appropriate I<DhMakePerl::Command::$command> class, constructs an instance
of it and calls its I<execute> method.

    my ( $class, %c ) = @_;
