=head1 NAME

Debian::Control::Stanza::Binary - binary stanza of Debian source package control file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $src = Debian::Control::Stanza::Binary->new(\%data);
    print $src;                         # auto-stringification
    print $src->Depends;                # Debian::Dependencies object

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Debian::Control::Stanza::Binary can be used for representation and manipulation
of C<Package:> stanza of Debian source package control files in an
object-oriented way. Converts itself to a textual representation in string
context.

=head1 FIELDS

The supported fields for binary stanzas are listed below. For more information
about each field's meaning, consult the section named C<Source package control
files -- debian/control> of the Debian Policy Manual at
L<http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/>

Note that real control fields may contain dashes in their names. These are
replaced with underscores.

=item Description

=back

C<Depends>, C<Conflicts>, C<Recommends>, C<Suggests>, C<Enhances>, C<Replaces>, 
and C<Pre_Depends> fields are converted to objects of L<Debian::Dependencies> 
class upon construction.

Two more accessor methods are provided for easier handling of package's short
and long description.

=over

=item short_description

=item long_description

=back

Setting them transparently modifies I<Description>. Note that the value of
I<long_description> is "unmangled", that is without leading spaces, and empty
lines are empty. I<Description> on the other hand is just as it looks in a
regular debian/control file - the long part is indented with a single space and
empty lines are replaced with dots.
