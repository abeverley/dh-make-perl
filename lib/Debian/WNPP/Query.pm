=head1 NAME

Debian::WNPP::Query - offline storage of Debian's work-needing package lists

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $wnpp = Debian::WNPP::Query->new(
        {   cache_dir       => '/somewhere',
            network_enabled => 0,
            ttl             => 3600 * 24,
            bug_types       => [qw( ITP RFP )]
        }
    );

    my @bugs = $wnpp->bugs_for_package('ken-lee');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Debian::WNPP::Query provides a way to retrieve and cache the contents of
Debian's "Work-needing and prospective packages" lists.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

B<new> is the constructor. Initial field values are to be given as a hash
reference.

If B<cache_file> is given, it is read.

=head1 FIELDS

=over

=item cache_file I<path>

The path to the file holding the offline cache of the WNPP lists. If not
specified, no cache is read or written.

=item ttl I<seconds>

The time after which the on-disk cache is considered too old and WNPP pages are
retrieved afresh. Ignored if B<cache_file> is not defined. Defaults to 86400 (1
day).

=item bug_types I<arrayref>

Specified which bug types to retrieve. For example, if you are interested in
ITP and RFP bugs, there is no point in downloading, parsing and storing
ITA/RFA/O bugs. By default all types of bugs are processed.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item bugs_for_package(I<package>)

Returns a list of bugs matching the given package name. Normally the list would
contain only one bug, but there are no guarantees.

=cut

sub bugs_for_package {
    my ( $self, $package ) = @_;

    my @result;
    for ( keys %list_url ) {
        if ( my $bug = $self->_cache->{$_}{$package} ) {
            push @result, $bug;
        }
    }

    return @result;
