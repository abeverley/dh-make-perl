=head1 NAME

Debian::Rules - handy manipulation of debian/rules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $r = Debian::Rules->new('debian/rules');

    my $r = Debian::Rules->new( { filename => 'debian/rules' } );

    $r->is_dhtiny && print "Using the latest and greatest\n";
    $r->is_quiltified && print "quilt rules the rules\n";

    # file contents changed externally
    $r->parse;

    $r->add_quilt;
    $r->drop_quilt;

    $r->write;  # or undef($r);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Some times, one needs to know whether F<debian/rules> uses the L<dh(1)>
tiny variant, or whether it is integrated with L<quilt(1)>. Debian::Rules
provides facilities to check this, as well as adding/removing quilt
integration.

Modified contents are written to file either vie the L</write> method, or when
the object reference goes out of scope (via DESTROY).

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

C<new> is the standard L<Class::Accessor> constructor, with the exception that
if only one, non-reference argument is provided, it is treated as a value for
the L<filename> field.

If a file name is given, the constructor calls L</read> to read the file
contents into memory.

One of B<filename> or B<lines> is mandatory.

=head1 FIELDS

=over

=item filename

Contains the file name of the rules file.

=item lines

Reference to an array pointing to the rules file. Initialized by L</new>.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item parse

Parses the rules file and stores its findings for later use. Called
automatically by L<is_dhtiny> and L<is_quiltified>. The result of the parsing
is cached and subsequent calls to C<is_XXX> use the cache. To force cache
refresh (for example if the contents of the file have been changed), call
C<parse> again.

=cut

sub parse {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->_is_dhtiny(0);
    $self->_is_quiltified(0);

    for ( my $i = 1; $i < @{ $self->lines }; $i++ ) {
        if (    $self->lines->[$i] =~ /^%:/
            and $i + 1 < @{ $self->lines }
            and $self->lines->[ $i + 1 ] =~ /^\tdh .*\$\@/ )
        {
            $self->_is_dhtiny(1);

            if ( $self->lines->[ $i + 1 ] =~ /--with[ =]quilt/ ) {
                $self->_is_quiltified(1);
                last;
            }
        }
    }

    $self->_parsed(1);
}

=item is_dhtiny

Returns true if the contents of the rules file seem to use the so called
I<tiny> variant offered by L<dh(1)>. Tiny rules are detected by the
presence of the following two lines:

    %:
            dh $@

(any options on the C<dh> command line ignored).

=cut

sub is_dhtiny {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->parse unless $self->_parsed;

    return $self->_is_dhtiny;
}

=item is_quiltified

Returns true if the contents of the rules file indicate that L<quilt(1)> is
used. Various styles of C<quilt> integration are detected:

=over

=item dh --with=quilt

=item F<quilt.make> with C<< $(QUILT_STAMPFN) >> and C<unpatch> targets.

=back

=cut

sub is_quiltified {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->parse unless $self->_parsed;

    return $self->_is_quiltified;
}

=item add_quilt

Integrates L<quilt(1)> into the rules. For L<dh(1)> I<tiny> rules (as
determined by L</is_dhtiny>) C<--with=quilt> is added to every C<dh>
invocation. For the more traditional variant, quilt is integrated via
F<quilt.make> and its C<< $(QUILT_STAMPFN) >> and C<unpatch> targets.

=cut

sub add_quilt {
    my $self = shift;

    return if $self->is_quiltified;

    my $lines = $self->lines;

    if ( $self->is_dhtiny) {
        for (@$lines) {

            # add --with=quilt to every dh call
            s/(?<=\s)dh /dh --with=quilt /
                unless /--with[= ]quilt/;    # unless it is already there
        }
    }
    else {

        # non-dhtiny
        splice @$lines, 1, 0,
            ( '', 'include /usr/share/quilt/quilt.make' )
            unless grep /quilt\.make/, @$lines;

            unless grep /override_dh_auto_clean:.*unpatch/, @$lines;
    }
}

=item drop_quilt

Removes L<quilt(1)> integration. Both L<dh(1)> I<tiny> style (C<dh
--with=quilt>) and traditional (C<< $(QUILT_STAMPFN) >> and C<unpatch>)
approaches are detected and removed.
