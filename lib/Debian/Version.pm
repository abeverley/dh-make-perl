=head1 NAME

Debian::Version - working with Debian package versions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One day this package may be a class for encapsulating Debian versions with all
of their epochs, versions and revisions. For now, though, it only provides a
single comparison function.

=cut

use base 'Exporter';

our @EXPORT_OK = qw( deb_ver_cmp );

use AptPkg::Config;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item deb_ver_cmp( $ver1, $ver2 )

Compares the Debian versions and returns -1, 0 or +1 if the first version is
smaller, equal or bigger than the second.

This function is a short-named wrapper around C<<
$AptPkg::Config::_config->system->versioning->compare >>.  The rules for
comparing Debian versions are defined in the L<Debian Policy Manual>.

=cut

sub deb_ver_cmp {
    my ( $ver1, $ver2 ) = @_;

    return $AptPkg::Config::_config->system->versioning->compare( $ver1,
        $ver2 );
}
