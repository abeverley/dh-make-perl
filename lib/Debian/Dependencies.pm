Debian::Dependencies -- a list of Debian::Dependency objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $dl = Debian::Dependencies->new('perl, libfoo-perl (>= 3.4)');
    print $dl->[1]->ver;      # 3.4
    print $dl->[1];           # libfoo-perl (>= 3.4)
    print $dl;                # perl, libfoo-perl (>= 3.4)

    $dl += 'libbar-perl';
    print $dl;                # perl, libfoo-perl (>= 3.4), libbar-perl

    print Debian::Dependencies->new('perl') + 'libfoo-bar-perl';
                              # simple 'sum'

    print Debian::Dependencies->new('perl')
          + Debian::Dependencies->new('libfoo, libbar');
                              # add (concatenate) two lists

    print Debian::Dependencies->new('perl')
          + Debian::Dependency->new('foo');
                              # add depeendency to a list

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Debian::Dependencies a list of Debian::Dependency objects, with automatic
construction and stringification.

Objects of this class are blessed array references. You can safely treat them
as arrayrefs, as long as the elements you put in them are instances of the
L<Debian::Dependency> class.

When used in string context, Debian::Dependencies converts itself into a
comma-delimitted list of dependencies, suitable for dependency fields of
F<debian/control> files.

=head2 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new(dependency-string)

Constructs a new L<Debian::Dependencies> object. Accepts one scalar argument,
which is parsed and turned into an arrayref of L<Debian::Dependency> objects.
Each dependency should be delimitted by a comma and optional space. The exact
regular expression is C</\s*,\s*/>.

=head2 OBJECT METHODS

=over 4

=item add( I<dependency> )

Adds I<dependency> to the list of dependencies. If the new dependency is a subset of or overlaps some of the old dependencies, it is not duplicated.

    my $d = Debian::Dependencies('foo, bar (<=4)');
    $d->add('foo (>= 4), bar');
    print "$d";     # foo (>= 4), bar (>= 4)

I<dependency> can be either a L<Debian::Dependency> object, a
L<Debian::Deendencies> object, or a string (in which case it is converted to an
instance of the L<Debian::Dependencies> class).

=cut

sub add {
    my( $self, $dep ) = @_;

    $dep = Debian::Dependencies->new($dep)
        unless ref($dep);

    $self += $dep;
}

=item remove( I<dependency>, ... )
=item remove( I<dependencies>, ... )

Removes a dependency from the list of dependencies. Instances of
L<Debian::Dependency> and L<Debian::Dependencies> classes are supported as
arguments.

Any non-reference arguments are coerced to instances of L<Debian::Dependencies>
class.

Only dependencies that are subset of the given dependencies are removed:

    my $deps = Debian::Dependencies->new('foo (>= 1.2), bar');
    $deps->remove('foo, bar (>= 2.0)');
    print $deps;    # bar

Returns the list of the dependencies removed.

=cut

sub remove {
    my( $self, @deps ) = @_;

    my ( @kept, @removed );

    for my $deps(@deps) {
        $deps = Debian::Dependencies->new($deps)
            unless ref($deps);

        for my $dep(@$deps) {
            for( @$self ) {
                if( $dep->satisfies($_) ) {
                    push @removed, $_;
                }
                else {
                    push @kept, $_;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    @$self = @kept;

    return @removed;
}

=item prune()

This method is deprecated. If you want to sort the dependency list, either call L</sort> or use normal perl sorting stuff on the dereferenced array.

=cut

sub prune {
    my $self = shift;

    use Carp ();
    Carp::croak("prune() is deprecated and does nothing");
}

=item sort

Sorts the dependency list by packagee name, version and relation.

=cut

sub sort {
    my( $self ) = @_;

    @$self = sort { $a <=> $b } @$self;
}
