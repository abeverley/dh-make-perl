GENERAL
=======

dh-make-perl helps create Debian packages out of CPAN distributions.

It does that by creating the files under the debian/ directory that are needed
by Debian tools to create the .deb file.

dh-make-perl can also help keep the packaging information current when upstream
dependencies etc change without re-creating the debian/ content from scratch.


INSTALLATION
============

Since dh-make-perl is only useful on Debian systems, you would probably prefer
to simply install the 'dh-make-perl' package.


BUGS ETC.
=========

Running 'reportbug dh-make-perl' (on a Debian system) is the preferred way of
sending bug reports. Failing that, you are free to use the queue on
rt.cpan.org, the mailing list or the IRC channel for bug reports.

For support, try the #debian-perl IRC channel (irc.debian.org, a.k.a. OFTC) or
the debian-perl@lists.debian.org mailing list (no subscription required, but
please mention if you want to be CC-ed on replies).
