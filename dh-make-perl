=head1 NAME

dh-make-perl - Create debian source packages from Perl modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=item dh-make-perl --refresh I<options...>

=item dh-make-perl --locate Foo::Bar

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<dh-make-perl> will create the files required to build
a debian source package out of a Perl module.
This works for most simple packages and is also useful
for getting started with packaging Perl modules.

You can specify a module name with the L<--cpan|/cpan_dist> switch
and B<dh-make-perl> will download the module for you from
a CPAN mirror, or you can specify the directory with the
already unpacked sources. If neither L<--cpan|/cpan_dist> nor a directory
is given as argument, B<dh-make-perl> tries to create a
Perl package from the data in the current directory.

There is an override mechanism in place to handle most of
the little changes that may be needed for some modules
(this hasn't been tested much, though, and the override
database needs to be filled in).

You can build and install the debian package using the L</--build>
and L</--install> command line switches.

If B<dh-make-perl> is called as

    cpan2deb <options...> Foo-Bar

it behaves like

    dh-make-perl <options...> --build --cpan Foo-Bar

Using this program is no excuse for not reading the
debian developer documentation, including the Debian policy,
the Debian Perl policy, the packaging manual and so on.

=head2 COMMANDS

=over

=item --make

Default command if no command is given. Creates debianisation from scratch.
Fails with an error if F<debian/> directory already exists.

=item --refresh

To be run inside unpacked source package. Rebuilds F<debian/copyright>,
F<debian/rules>, F<debian/compat> using the current templates.

This is useful when F<debian/rules> was created using older templates and
doesn't contain much customisations. As always, you're strongly encouraged to
verify if F<debian/rules> looks sane.

--refresh also tries to update dependency lists in F<debian/control> from
F<META.yml>. It hooks L<quilt(1)> into F<debian/rules> and creates F<debian/README.source>

=item --locate I<MODULE>

Tries to locate the package that conains the given Perl I<MODULE>.

Example:

    dh-make-perl --locate IPC::Run3

=item --refresh-cache

B<dh-make-perl> parses the Contents files, fetched by L<apt-file(1)> and stores
the result in a cache. The cache is refreshed automatically if it is older than
any Contents file. However, if you run L<apt-file(1)> in your nightly cron job,
the first time you run B<dh-make-perl> during the day, you shall wait for the
cache to be reconstructed. With this option, you can move the cache re-creation
to the cron job, right after C<apt-file update>.

Does nothing if the cache is newer that the Contents files.

=item --dump-config

Causes the current config, including any default settings to be printed to the
standard output.

Useful for populating L<dh-make-perl.conf> file.

=back

=head2 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--arch> I<any> | I<all>

This switches between arch-dependent and arch-independet packages. If B<--arch>
isn't used, B<dh-make-perl> uses a relatively good-working algorithms to
decide this alone.

=item B<--basepkgs>

Explicitly gives a comma-separated list of packages to consider "base"
packages (i.e. packages that should always be available in Debian
systems). This option defaults to C<perl,perl-base,perl-modules> - it
is used to check for module dependencies. If a needed module is in the
C<basepkgs>, it won't be mentioned in the C<depends:> field of
C<debian/control>.

If this option is specified, the above mentioned default packages will
not be included (but will be mentioned as explicit dependencies in the
resulting package). You can, of course, mention your own modules
and explicitly specify the default values.

Note that this option should be used sparsingly and with care, as it
might lead to packages not being rebuildable because of unfulfilled
dependencies.

=item B<--bdepends> I<BUILD-DEPENDS>

Manually specify the string to be used for the module's build-dependencies
(that is, the packages and their versions that have to be installed in order to
successfully build the package). Keep in mind that packages generated by
B<dh-make-perl> require debhelper to be specified as a build dependency. Same note
as for --depends applies here - use only when needed.

=item B<--bdependsi> I<BUILD-DEPENDS-INDEP>

Manually specify the string to be used for the module's build-dependencies
for architecture-independent builds. Same notes as those for the --depends 
and --bdepends options apply here.

Note that for --depends, --bdepends and --bdependsi you can also specify that
the field should not appear in debian/rules (if you really mean it, of course
;-) ) by giving it an empty string as an argument.

=item B<--build>

Builds the package after setting it up.

NB: This builds only a binary package (by calling "fakeroot debian/rules
binary") and does not sign the package. It is meant for a quick local
install of a package, not for creating a package ready for submission to the
Debian archive.

=item B<--closes> I<ITPBUG>

Manually specify the ITP bug number that this package closes. If not 
given, B<dh-make-perl> will try to connect to bugs.debian.org to fetch the 
appropriate bug number, using WWW::Mechanize.

=item B<--core-ok>

Allows building core Perl modules. By default, B<dh-make-perl> will not allow
building a module that is shipped as part of the standard Perl library; by
specifying this option, B<dh-make-perl> will build them anyway.

Note that, although it is not probable, this might break unrelated items in 
your system - if a newer version of a core module breaks the API, all kinds
of daemons might get upset ;-)

=item B<--cpan> I<DIST>

Instructs B<dh-make-perl> to fetch and extract the given CPAN distribution.

=item B<--cpan-mirror> I<MIRROR>

Specifies a CPAN site to use as mirror.

=item B<--data-dir> I<DIRECTORY>

Use another data directory, instead of the default, C</usr/share/dh-make-perl>

Data directory is were B<dh-make-perl> looks for its default rules.* templates.
It is similar to B<--home-dir>, but does not change the location of the APT
Contents cache file. If both are given, B<--home-dir> takes precedence.

=item B<--depends> I<DEPENDS>

Manually specify the string to be used for the module's dependencies. This 
should be used when building modules where B<dh-make-perl> cannot guess the Perl
dependencies (such as modules built using L<Module::Install>), or when the
Perl code depends on non-Perl binaries or libraries. Usually, B<dh-make-perl>
will figure out the dependencies by itself. If you need to pass B<dh-make-perl>
dependency information, you must do it using the debian package format. i.e.

    dh-make-perl --depends libtest-more-perl 

=item B<--desc> I<SHORT DESCRIPTION>

Uses the argument to --desc as short description for the package.

=item B<--dh> I<VERSION>

Set desired debhelper version. If C<ver> is 7, generated debian/rules is
minimalistic, using the auto-mode of debhelper. Also, any additional
documentation and examples are listed in additional files under debian/, instead
of being listed in debian/rules

=item B<--dist> I<DISTRIBUTION>

Limit the distributions whose C<Contents> files are parsed. The argument is a distribution name.

Default: empty, meaning no filtering.

Example:
    dh-make-perl --dist etch

=item B<--email> | B<-e> I<EMAIL>

Manually specify the Maintainer email address to use in debian/control and
in debian/changelog.

=item B<--exclude> | B<-i> [I<REGEX>]

This allows you to specify a PCRE to exclude some files from the search for
docs and stuff like that. If no argument is given (but the switch is specified
- not specifying the switch will include everything), it defaults to
dpkg-source's default values.

=item B<--install>

Installs the freshly built package. Specifying --install implies --build - The
package will not be installed unless it was built (obviously ;-) )

=item B<--home-dir> I<DIRECTORY>

Where user overrides and APT Contents cache is stored.

Default: ~/.dh-make-perl

=item B<--packagename> | B<-p> I<PACKAGENAME>

Manually specify the Package Name, useful when the module has dashes in its
name.

=item B<--pkg-perl>

Useful when preparing a package for the Debian Perl Group
L<http://pkg-perl.alioth.debian.org>.

Sets C<Maintainer>, C<Uploaders>, C<Vcs-Svn> and C<Vcs-Browser> fields in
F<debian/control> accordingly.

=item B<--requiredeps>

Fail if a dependency Perl package was not found (dependency tracking
requires the apt-file package installed and updated)

=item B<--sources-list> I<FILE>

Instruct the C<Contents> file parser to use this B<file> when determining if a
given file should be parsed or not. Contents files not matching any line in
B<sources.list> are not parsed in order to save you time parsing old files from
mirrors you no longer use.

Default: C</etc/apt/sources.list>

=item B<--verbose> | B<--no-verbose>

Print additional information while processing.

--verbose is on by default if L</--make> is given, off otherwise.

=item B<--version> I<VERSION>

Specifies the version of the resulting package.

=back

=head1 FILES

The following directories will be searched to find additional files
required by B<dh-make-perl>:

	/usr/share/dh-make-perl/
	$HOME/.dh-make-perl/

=over 4

=item * dh-make-perl.conf

User configuration. The file is in YAML format. The keys are option names,
as documented in L</OPTIONS> (without leading I<-->).

See the output of C<dh-make-perl --dump-config>, which can also be used for
population of F<dh-make-perl.conf>.

=item * overrides

File that overrides information retreived (or guessed) about the package.
All the files in the library directories are loaded: entries in the home
take precedence. See the distributed overrides file for usage information.

=item * rules.MakeMaker.noxs

A debian/rules makefile for modules that use ExtUtils::MakeMaker, but don't
have C/XS code.

=item * rules.MakeMaker.xs

A debian/rules makefile for modules that use ExtUtils::MakerMaker and
C/XS code.

=item * rules.Module-Build.noxs

A debian/rules makefile for modules that use Module::Build, but don't have 
C/XS code.

=item * rules.Module-Build.xs

A debian/rules makefile for modules that use Module::Build and C/XS code.
