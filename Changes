  * DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging:
    - install CONTRIBUTING files in extract_docs().
    - require debhelper 9.20120312 only for arch:any packages;
      for arch:all debhelper 8 or 9 are enough
    - add a trailing ~ to all versioned dependencies to make
      backporting easier
    - drop special casing for all kinds of dependencies which needed
      debhelper 7.x.
      Support for debhelper < 8 was dropped in dh-make-perl 0.77.

    guess_tarball($prefix) and guess_debian_tarball() and then using
    guess_tarball() also in setup_dir().
  * Iterate over all supported tar ball suffixes in guess_tarball().
  * Use Cwd's realpath for upstream tarball search if main_dir is just "."

  [ Dima Kogan ]
  * Not importing IO::Dir since I'm not using it
  * better handling of upstream-supplied debian/ directories.  If we are
    making a git repo I now remove debian/ directory if the upstream ships
    it. This goes into the 'master' branch, so the 'upstream' branch
    contains the original debian/ directory, and thus matches the
    pristine-tar

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * DhMakePerl::Command::make: Try to guess tarball name when run from an
    unpacked source directory.
  * DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging: Don't sanitize version if given on the

  * Update years of copyright.
  * DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging: replace "This library" with the module
    name in the long description, like we already did with "This module".

  [ Axel Beckert ]

    "-vX.Y.Z". (Closes: #701140)
  * Fix "fatal: pathspec 'â€¦' did not match any files" error of "git
    add". (Closes: #659526)
  * Add option --build-source to build .dsc file (c.f. #645011). Also add
    a cpan2dsc 'flavour' of dh-make-perl. If it is called by that name,
    the behaviour changes for easy .dsc creation.
  * Mention cpan2deb and cpan2dsc in the long description.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

  [ Oleg Gashev ]
  * Fixed timestamp regexp to t/dists.t file. If time zone is EDT, failed
    tests from t/dists.t file: Generated tree matches template. Problem
    with incorrect timestamp regexp.

  [ Damyan Ivanov ]
  * Dependency: assume '>=' relationship if missing when constructing from
    hash /usr/share/perl5/Debian/Dependency.pm line 157. Thanks to Robert
    Norris for his patience and his excellent analysis. (Closes: #704480)
  * exclude README in the root directory from .docs "in 9x% we remove it
    from .docs afterwards" this change is a bit of a "big gun", because it
    doesn't really check if README is autogenerated, but hey, fixing a 90%
    false-positive hit is better than introducing a 10% false-negative hit
    (Closes: #608936)
  * drop mangling versions like 2.003004 into 2.3.4 this partially reverts

    back in 2010 (TODO is interesting) the fix seems to cause more
    problems than it solves. matching cpan-version to debian version is

    ExtUtils::ParseXS 2.21
  * bump copyright years
  * configure_cpan: ignore prerequisites to avoid unnecessary prompts
  * setup_dir: ignore $dist->get return value.
    POD says nothing about it, so false doesn't indicate failure.
    false is sometimes returned when some prerequisites aren't
    satisfied, which is not important for us. (Closes: #686739)

    (cf. RT#71708).
  * Fix POD: --pkg-perl sets Vcs-Git, of course.
  * Treat META.json like META.yml (i.e. rm/unlink/ignore it).
  * DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging: don't initialize CPAN if --no-network
    is set. Otherwise t/cache.t fails because CPAN tries to update its
    config and goes out hunting for CPAN mirrors.
  * t/dists.t: allow multiple years in Copyright line.
    "refresh" adds the current year to the years of copyright.
    In other words: This was a "New Year's Bug".

  * Do not die when the WNPP cache cannot be read, for example due to binary
    format change in Storable. Also, use platform-independent storage.

    alternative dependencies when a given module is found in more than one
