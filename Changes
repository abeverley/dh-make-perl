  MIN_PERL_VERSION to determine the version of the package. Thanks to
  Andrew Ruthven for reporting.

  [ Salvatore Bonaccorso ]
  dh --buildsystem=buildsystem needs at least debhelper (>= 7.3.7), add this

        Debian bug #525847

    spelling fixes in POD and comments

    [ Ansgar Burchardt ]
    Do not require --cpan in addition to --pkg-perl when adding Vcs-* fields.

    Debian::Dependency: Recognize deprecated '<' and '>' relations.

    Debian::Dependency: Allow architecture restrictions in dependencies.
    For now this information is just ignored.

    DhMakePerl::Command::Packaging (set_package_name): Use package name
    specified by --packagename option. (Debian bug #584619)

    dh-make-perl: Fix spelling error ("intercepring" â†’ "intercepting").

    Debian::WNPP::Query: Fix bugs_for_package method.

    Debian::Control::FromCPAN (discover_dependencies): Do not ignore results
    from Module::Depends::Intrusive. (Debian bug #587276)

    [ Salvatore Bonaccorso ]
    Add support of Breaks field for binary package stanzas in debian/control
    to Debian::Control::Stanza::Binary.

    Create packages with Standards-Version: 3.9.1.

    Fix sentences in texts for License stanzas of debian/copyright: Add full
    stop mark after sentences.

    Add explicit Link to versioned `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-1' as this 
    was added by base-files 5.8 (See debian bug #436105).

    Fix debian/copyright text templates in t/dist/Strange-0.1 and
    t/dist/Strange-2.1.

    Add support for perl_dbi addon for dh.

    Build-Depends only on perl when Build.PL and Module::Build is used,
    instead of an alternate Build-Depends on perl (>= 5.10) |
    libmodule-build-perl. This is as support for Etch is now discontinued and
    Lenny already contains perl (>= 5.10) (Debian bug #590114).

    [ Chris Butler ]
    Fixed DhMakePerl::Utils to cope with modules in Module::CoreList where the
    version is unspecified. (Debian bug #585755)

0.68 (2010-05-04)

    Build.PL: add no_index as an attempt to avoid PAUSE indexing private stuff

    My::Builder: 'orig' target now creates identical (hard-linked)
        DhMakePerl-VERSION.tar.gz and dh-make-perl_VERSION.orig.tar.gz files

    My::Builder: streamline messages in the 'dist' and 'orig' actions

    Control.t: ensure dependency fields are wrapped properly

    make: fix a typo (DpkgList -> DpkgLists). Thanks to Dominic Hargreaves
        Debian bug #580101

    modules_already_packaged: fix ModuleInfo instantiation

    Config: honour values given to the constructor

    DpkgLists.t: do not insist that '/bin/perl' (or the corresponding regex) is
        only in perl-base. Instead, ensure that 'perl-base' is present in the
        returned list. Debian bug #580025

    make: drop $VERSION; some POD rewrite (was a blind copy of DhMakePerl.pm)

0.67
    POD: drop "--" in front of the commands.
    refresh: ensure ->rules is there before attempting to fiddle quilt
        integration

    Add support for version relations in META

    Debian::Dependency now survives being given a string with leading spaces

    make: implement recursive making of missing dependencies when --recursive
        is given. (Debian bug #342751)

    FromCPAN: remove leading 'v' from versions

    add Debian::DpkgLists - 'dpkg -S' on steroids

    FromCPAN: use Debian::DpkgLists as a last resort. This allows finding
        dependencies that are present in locally-installed packages.
        (Debian bug #478781)

    Dependency: the 'ver' member is an instance of Dpkg::Version
        Use its ability to compare and drop Debian::Version

    Dependenc{y,ies}: reduce '--' to '-' in the NAME POD section

    make: try harder to discover already existing package by looking up
        distribution modules in APT contents and dpkg file lists.

    replace CPAN::Config->load with CPAN:Handle::Config->load
        the former seems obsolete and only warns:
            Dispatching deprecated method 'CPAN::Config::load' to
            CPAN::HandleConfig

    added README

    added xt/pod-spelling.t to help test POD spelling
