* --refresh: add --[no-]backups option (on by default)
  used for controlling creation of backup files of things that are rewritten

* --refresh and core dependencies
  when a dependency module is in the core, do not blindly copy the version
  dependend on to perl-modules dependency, but use the first perl release the
  dependency is included in.
  mapping perl core versions to debian versions would be nice, otherwise we end up
  with something like "perl-modules (>= 5.9.4)" (happened with libparams-classify-perl).
  also, depending on perl-base is perhaps not a good idea
* use Dpkg::Version::vercmp(v1, v2) for comparing versions all over (grep for
  compare)
* investigate using Cmd::App
* ensure (with a test) that dependency lists are indentedd with one space
* ensure (with a test) that doing a refresh over the debian/ directory produced
  by --make doesn't change anything
