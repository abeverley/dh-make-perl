* --refresh: add --[no-]backups option (on by default)
  used for controlling creation of backup files of things that are rewritten

* --refresh and core dependencies
  when a dependency module is in the core, do not blindly copy the version
  dependend on to perl-modules dependency, but use the first perl release the
  dependency is included in.
  also, depending on perl-base is perhaps not a good idea
