* investigate using App::Cmd
* ensure (with a test) that dependency lists are indented with one space
* ensure (with a test) that doing a refresh over the debian/ directory produced
  by --make doesn't change anything
* --refresh on MIME-Charset 1.007 can't detect the dist name and cries.
  May be similar to #525847
* when ITP for the package is found, try to deduce short/long description from
  the bug report
* add new command, --trace-depends. To be used like

   dh-make-perl --trace-depends --cpan Foo-Bar

  it shall output a tree-like structure of missing dependencies without
  preparing any packaging yet

  Ryan52 already has a program which does this, in svn as
   ./scripts/cpan-unpackaged-deps.pl. Steal code. or wait for Ryan52
   to eventually do it himself.
* when a dependency is not packaged, search wnpp's bugs and report if there is
  ITP about the package
* versioned dependencies should add the epochs too (found in
  libpoex-role-sessioninstantiation-perl, where META.yml and Build.PL
  request 'POE 1.005' which should translate to "libpoe-perl (>= 2:1.0050)")
* package_already_exists(): maybe search for the module and not the package name;
  otherwise existing packages are missed that have a different name (cf. #530675)
* --refresh: add --only <file> option: done, but "--only control" also
  touches d/rules if quilt is used
* quiltification: switch to "--with quilt" in d/rules and adjust build deps
  -- or just to "3.0 (quilt)"
* Don't add libmodule-build-perl to Build-Depends if Makefile.PL is also
  present, if its not just Module::Build::Compat
* 3.0 source format support for dh-make-perl
* module versions: if META.yml contains e.g. "v1.002000" for 1.2.0 then
  extract_name_ver returns exactly "v1.002000" (not good), and extract_basic
  adds a leading "0" (even worse). we somehow need to get those versions
  back. or strip the "v". or something. - at least if the tarball is
  Foo-Bar-v1.2.0.
