* investigate using App::Cmd
* ensure (with a test) that dependency lists are indented with one space
* --refresh on MIME-Charset 1.007 can't detect the dist name and cries.
  May be similar to #525847
* when ITP for the package is found, try to deduce short/long description from
  the bug report
* versioned dependencies should add the epochs too (found in
  libpoex-role-sessioninstantiation-perl, where META.yml and Build.PL
  request 'POE 1.005' which should translate to "libpoe-perl (>= 2:1.0050)")
* --refresh: add --only <file> option: done, but "--only control" also
  touches d/rules if quilt is used
* #536838: Incorrect assumptions about perl module version -> debian package
  version. Some way of figuring out that libfoo-perl 3.42 contains Bar::Baz
  4.23 is needed. while not common, version discrepacy is very annoying.
  TODO: investigate usage of UDD. (1) can the info "package version module
  module-version" be imported and (2) would it be possible to query that from
  the web somehow. A separate question is how useful it would be for
  dh-make-perl to query the web about this info.
