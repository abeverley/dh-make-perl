* investigate using App::Cmd
* ensure (with a test) that dependency lists are indented with one space
* --refresh on MIME-Charset 1.007 can't detect the dist name and cries.
  May be similar to #525847
* when ITP for the package is found, try to deduce short/long description from
  the bug report
* add new command, --trace-depends. To be used like

   dh-make-perl --trace-depends --cpan Foo-Bar

  it shall output a tree-like structure of missing dependencies without
  preparing any packaging yet

  Ryan52 already has a program which does this, in svn as
   ./scripts/cpan-unpackaged-deps.pl. Steal code. or wait for Ryan52
   to eventually do it himself.
* versioned dependencies should add the epochs too (found in
  libpoex-role-sessioninstantiation-perl, where META.yml and Build.PL
  request 'POE 1.005' which should translate to "libpoe-perl (>= 2:1.0050)")
* package_already_exists(): maybe search for the module and not the package name;
  otherwise existing packages are missed that have a different name (cf. #530675)
  This is true for distributions that don't match the contained module, like
  libintl-perl, which has Locale::* modules.
  The way to solve this is perhaps to extract "package Foo::Bar" from all *.pm
  files and look them in the apt file contents. Lots of work for little gain.
* --refresh: add --only <file> option: done, but "--only control" also
  touches d/rules if quilt is used
* --make should use Debian::Control::FromCPAN for dependencies
* do not blindly overwrite debian/rules in --refresh
  keep it intact if it is already dh7tiny-style
* grepping for "Module::Build::Compat" in Makefile.PL is not enough; when it's only
  created with M:B:C we don't need a build-dep on M::B, only when it calls
  M::B. detected when refreshing libtk-dirselect-perl
