* run
    make orig
  this will create ../dh-make-perl_$VERSION.orig.tar.gz and
  ../DhMakePerl-$VERSION.tar.gz (hardlinked to each other).

* build the package as usual and watch for failing tests

* apply the usual quality checks, e.g. lintian

* make sure Changes is populated for the new release. Good source of changes to
  include there is debian/changelog and/or git logs

  (assuming debian/changelog is already updated with the list of changes)

* if everything seems ok, run
    dch -r
  and build again

* upload
  - ../dh-make-perl_$VERSION.orig.tar.gz to alioth, naming the release $VERSION
  - ../DhMakePerl-$VERSION.tar.gz to PAUSE, e.g. with cpan-upload

* tag
    debcommit -a -r

* increase version number
    git grep $ver
    sed -i -e 's/$ver/$ver+1/' file...
    git ci -a -m'increment version to $ver+1'

* push
    dpt push

* serve yourself a piece of cake :)
